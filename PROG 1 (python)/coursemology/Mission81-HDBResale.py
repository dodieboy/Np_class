#   HDB Resale Prices   #   
#########################

#Background
#==========
#Tom is conducting some research into HDB resale prices as part of his part-time work for a real estate agency.
#Write a program to find out the following:

#a) The 2017 average price for the 4-room flat type (in 2 decimal places)
#b) The number of transactions above the average resale prices in part (a)
#c) The town with the highest resale price for the 5-room flat type in 2017

#Return the result of the three parts in a list of 3 items (e.g., [34535.35,20,'Hougang']

#Important Notes
#===============
#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You MUST use the following variables
#   four_room_average, above_average, town_highest
