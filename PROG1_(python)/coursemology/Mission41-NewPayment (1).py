#Background
#==========
#To support the government initiative to help seniors with their living expenses,
#all supermarkets in Singapore will give a 5% discount for seniors who are aged 60
#and above

#Write a Python program to check whether a person is eligible for discount
#and if he is, then calculate the new amount he has to pay.
#
#The program is to prompt user for his age, and amount to pay 
#and check his eligibility and calculate the new amount to pay
#and display the original and new amounts to pay.

#Important Notes
#===============
#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You MUST use the following variables
#   - age
#   - amount
#   - new_amount
