We will start by naively training a small convnet on our training samples, without any regularization, to set a baseline for what can be achieved. This will get us to a classification accuracy of around 70%. At that point, our main issue will be overfitting. Then we will introduce *data augmentation*, a powerful technique for mitigating overfitting in computer vision. By leveraging data augmentation, we will improve our network to reach an accuracy of around 80%."

This is the role of the `steps_per_epoch` argument: after having drawn `steps_per_epoch` batches from the generator, i.e. after having run for `steps_per_epoch` gradient descent steps, the fitting process will go to the next epoch. In our case, batches are 20-sample large, so it will take 100 batches (=20*100 samples) until we see our target of 2000 samples.\n",
