#Admission to Singapore museums is free for Singapore citizens (SC) and permanent residents (PR). 
#All others will have to pay $15 per entry.

#Write a Python program to calculate the price of tickets for a group of visitors consisting
#of SC, PR and others.
#
#The program is to prompt user for the total number visitors and the number of SCs and PRs
#calculate the total cost of the tickets,
#and display this cost.

#Important Notes

#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You MUST use the following variables
#   - total_no_visitors
#   - num_SCandPR
#   - total_cost

    if :        #Check number of other visitors
        total_cost =     #calculate total price of tickets
        print() #Modify to display total price of tickets
    else:
        total_cost =     #calculate total price of tickets
        print() #Modify to display that Admission is free for all        
    return total_cost #Do not remove this line

    
#Do not remove the next line
calculate_cost(total_no_visitors, num_SCandPR)
