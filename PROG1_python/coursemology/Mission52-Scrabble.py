#Background
#==========
#Tom is playing scrabble with his group of friends. He has drawn 5 letters from
#the bag. Tom wants to count the number of possible 5-letters words he can form.
#Factorial functions are frequently used to identify the number of ways to arrange
#a group of objects.

#Given the number of objects as n,
#	Factorial of n = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x (n-3) x â€¦ x 2 x 1
#	e.g. factorial of 5 = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1

#Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the number of letters, and calculate
#the number of possible n-letters word combination that can be formed.

#Note: There is no need to consider if the words are found in a dictionary.



#Important Notes
#===============
#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You are to complete this question with a variation of while and if statements.
#3) You MUST use the following variables
#   - number_of_letters
#   - result
